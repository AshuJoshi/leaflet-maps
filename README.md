# Interactive Maps with Leaflet
> Learning web mapping using Leaflet


From the [Leaflet website](http://leafletjs.com/):

*Leaflet is the leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. Weighing just about 33 KB of JS, it has all the mapping features most developers ever need.*

These maps let you select a base layer, and interact with two different choropleth maps of the US. 

1. An interactive map of the US Population Density - cloned from the Leaflet tutorial on [Choropleth Maps](http://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/)
2. A second overlay that shows the Renewable Portfolios of the US States. This was inspired by the data published by NCSL [here](http://www.ncsl.org/research/energy/renewable-portfolio-standards.aspx).
